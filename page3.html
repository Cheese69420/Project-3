            <p>I play Apex Legends, which is one of my favorite games. It's a highly competitive PvP game where you go up against 50 other players. I mostly play as Revenant, a character with the ability to climb walls and use a shield bubble. His backstory is that he was an assassin.</p>

            <p>I also play Minecraft, mainly the modded version. I enjoy mods like RLcraft, which is a much more difficult version of Minecraft with more structures and even dragons.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I play modded Black Ops 3 zombies. I enjoy maps like Space Tower, which is a challenging tower where you have to keep climbing. Itâ€™s a pretty tough map, but I was able to beat it after about two days while playing with my friend.</p>
